## Architecture
- **Clean Architecture**
  - **External Layers**: 
    - Web: Controllers for handling requests and managing client-server communication.
    - Infrastructure: Manages external resources such as databases, email service, PDF generation, image service, and auth management.
  - **Core Layers**:
    - Application Layer: Implements business logic and orchestrates interactions between components.
    - Domain Layer: Contains fundamental business rules and entities, independent of external concerns like databases or user interfaces.

## Technology Stack Overview

### Technologies Used

- **C#**: Main programming language.
- **ASP.NET Core**: Framework for building high-performance, cross-platform web APIs.

### Database

- **Entity Framework Core**: Employing Entity Framework Core for streamlined object-relational mapping (ORM) within the .NET ecosystem, simplifying database interactions.
- **SQL Server**: Utilizing SQL Server for reliable and scalable backend database management, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of application data.

### Image Storage

- **Firebase Storage**: Part of Google's Firebase platform, offers cloud-based storage for images in this hotel booking system. It provides scalability, reliability, and seamless API integration.

### API Documentation and Design

- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: For API specification and documentation.
- **Swagger UI**: Provides a user-friendly interface for API interaction.

### Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure transmission of information between parties.

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Serilog**: Logging library for .NET applications.

### Design Patterns

- **RESTful Principles**:  Adhering to RESTful design principles to ensure that APIs are designed for simplicity, scalability, and ease of use.
- **Repository Pattern**:  Implementing the repository pattern to abstract the data layer, enhancing application maintainability, testability, and cleanliness by decoupling data access logic from business logic.
- **Options Pattern**: For efficient configuration management within the application.
- **Unit of Work**: Manages transactions across multiple data operations, ensuring atomicity and data consistency within a single logical unit.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separates read and write operations, optimizing flexibility and scalability by using specialized models for queries and commands.

### Security

- **HTTPS**: Ensures secure communication over the network.
- **Data Encryption**: Password hashing using `Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.IPasswordHasher`.

## API Versioning
This API leverages the Asp.Versioning.Mvc library to implement a streamlined header-based versioning mechanism. This approach facilitates seamless client access to different API versions without requiring adjustments to the base URL or path. By utilizing headers, the versioning process is standardized and offers improved clarity and maintainability. This method also enhances flexibility and ease of integration for users while ensuring optimal compatibility with various client applications.
curl?
This API uses Asp.Versioning.Mvc for header-based versioning, allowing seamless access to different versions without changing the URL. It standardizes versioning via headers, improving clarity and flexibility for users and compatibility with client apps.

Users can effortlessly specify their preferred API version by including the x-api-version header in their requests. In instances where no version is explicitly specified, the API seamlessly defaults to the latest available version. For instance:

To explicitly request version 1.0:
```bash
curl -X GET "localhost:5116/api/cities" -H "x-api-version: 1.0"
```


To utilize the latest version by default:
```bash
curl -X GET "localhost:5116/api/cities"
```

## Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions on setting up an existing ASP.NET API project. Follow these steps to clone the repository, configure the `appsettings.json` file, and run the API locally.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your system.
- Running SQL Server instance with a database.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository of your existing ASP.NET API project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nedal-Esrar/Travel-and-Accommodation-Booking-Platform.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change your current directory to the root directory of your ASP.NET API project:

```bash
cd Travel-and-Accommodation-Booking-Platform/TABP.Api
```

#### 3. Configure `appsettings.json`

Open the `appsettings.json` file located in your project directory and configure the connection string for SQL Server. Replace the `<connection_string>` placeholder with your SQL Server connection string:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "SqlServer": "<connection_string>"
  }
}
```

#### 4. Run the API Locally

Start the ASP.NET API project using the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The API will be accessable using https://localhost:7169.

The swagger UI will open automatically where you can try and explore the endpoints or you can open it using https://localhost:7169/swagger.
